## Supported Versions

There is currently no version available, which is officially supported. The
development is a still ongoing process. Starting with version 1.0.0, the
software will be supported. To sum everything up, here the supported version
list:

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Even if it's not the optimal way of reporting a vulnerability, the only way
right now is to open an issue and tag it with `bug` and `security`. There
will be better ways in the future.
